# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added a scrollable "View Full Command" permission prompt viewer (keyboard ↑↓/PgUp/PgDn/Home/End), so compacted prompts can be inspected in full before deciding.
- Added Bash syntax-tree analysis for control operators, pipelines, nested shell constructs, substitutions, heredocs, and redirections.
- Added per-command permission details to Bash prompts and review logs.
- `edit` tool calls that cannot be applied to the current file content (stale or duplicate `oldText`, missing target file, overlapping or no-op replacements, empty `oldText`) are now blocked silently with Pi's own edit-tool error text instead of prompting the user to approve a doomed edit.

### Changed
- Bash rules now match each executable command unit and aggregate with `deny > ask > allow`; whole compound-command patterns no longer bypass rules for nested or chained commands.
- Bash output redirections now require an explicit matching rule instead of inheriting a plain command allow (for example, `echo *` no longer allows `echo aaaa > file`); fd duplication such as `2>&1` writes no file and stays covered by the plain rule.
- Bash `Allow Always` approvals now match the exact original command string for the current session.

### Security
- Bash parse failures, oversized scripts, parser initialization failures, and dynamic command names now require confirmation instead of inheriting broad allow rules.
- `file://` URLs in path-bearing tool inputs now resolve before external-directory checks, so `special.external_directory` policy applies to them instead of treating them as in-worktree paths.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-03

### Changed
- Extracted shared utilities and consolidated permission matching. ([d1875bd](https://github.com/MasuRii/pi-permission-system/commit/d1875bdd1a26989bdd8cd1193cad9a50622897f6))
- Preserved non-extension config fields and handled symlinks during config writes. ([acd5c79](https://github.com/MasuRii/pi-permission-system/commit/acd5c79850bfbe00c4511f333b6ea14c6f904178))
- Narrowed types and consolidated modal rendering. ([d2ea4f8](https://github.com/MasuRii/pi-permission-system/commit/d2ea4f8160975bc2b7e1bdc03464841acbc28ad3))
- Extracted a shared test harness and added regression tests. ([cd9a253](https://github.com/MasuRii/pi-permission-system/commit/cd9a253beddd6670b70c0ea3e74f234db2c137c4))
- Updated README with badges, a Ko-fi link, and Bun test instructions. ([7e57c47](https://github.com/MasuRii/pi-permission-system/commit/7e57c47144985da433b6cd1642978026b9cff051))
- Widened Pi peer dependency compatibility to include `^0.80.0` and added vulnerability overrides (`protobufjs`, `ws`). ([0ed23af](https://github.com/MasuRii/pi-permission-system/commit/0ed23af51e5ca0897c83175b420d07fee8823921))

### Removed
- Removed `PermanentApprovalStore` and the `pi-permission-system-approvals.json` persistence file. `Allow Always` now records session-only (in-memory) approvals via `SessionApprovalStore`, matching the documented behavior. Cross-session persistent approvals are no longer written to disk. ([a33ac2c](https://github.com/MasuRii/pi-permission-system/commit/a33ac2c5159eacb81b87b673706902cd95a27029))

## [0.7.1] - 2026-06-16

### Added
- Added resource-qualified path rules for path-bearing built-in tools (`read`, `write`, `edit`, `find`, `grep`, `ls`) using action-scoped `tools` keys such as `read:/home/alice/project/generated/*`.
- Added resource-qualified `external_directory` rules using `external_directory:<normalized-path>/*` for specific outside-worktree directories.

### Changed
- Clarified that `Allow Once` approves only the current request, `Allow Always` records an explicit matching approval for the current session only, and plain `Reject` does not become a future default.
- Clarified that YOLO/auto-response approvals do not create saved approval rules.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- Added `SessionApprovalStore` for in-memory per-session permission approval tracking with `approveAlways`, `approveOnce`, `hasSessionApproval`, and `evaluate` methods.
- Added `evaluate-permission.ts` module with `evaluatePermission()` function that evaluates tool+command pairs against multiple rulesets with last-match-wins semantics.
- Added forwarded permission prompt auto-denial timeout (30 seconds) so unanswered forwarded subagent prompts automatically deny instead of blocking indefinitely.
- Added `Allow Once`/`Allow Always`/`Reject`/`Reject with Reason` permission decision options replacing the previous `Yes`/`No`/`No, provide reason` labels.
- Added `PI_DELEGATED_AUTH_RUNTIME_DIR` and `PI_PERMISSION_SYSTEM_POLICY_AGENT_DIR` environment variable support for resolving forwarded permission request directories when launched by delegated auth or policy agent routers.
- Added notification warning when a forwarded subagent permission prompt is displayed.
- Added automatic expiration of forwarded permission requests that exceed the 10-minute forwarding timeout before display.
- Added pruning of hidden structured skill references (table rows and list items) from system prompts when the referenced skill name is not fully allowed.

### Changed
- Consolidated three separate logging options (`debugLog`, `permissionReviewLog`, `logPlaintextBashCommands`) into a single `debug` config toggle that writes both diagnostics and permission review entries to one `pi-permission-system-debug.jsonl` file.
- Updated wildcard matcher to normalize backslashes to forward slashes on Windows, add case-insensitive matching on Windows, and support `?` single-character wildcards and trailing ` .*` optional-space patterns.
- Skill prompt sanitizer now hides all non-allow skills (including `ask`) from the advertised available-skills section instead of only hiding `deny` skills.
- Migrated test suite from Bun to Node.js with tsx and Node experimental test module mocks.
- Widened Pi peer dependency compatibility to include `^0.77.0 || ^0.78.0`.
- Replaced `PermissionDecisionState` values `approved`/`denied`/`denied_with_reason` with `once`/`always`/`reject` in the permission decision API.

### Fixed
- Fixed forwarded permission response directory resolution when subagents are launched by delegated auth or router components with isolated `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`.
- Fixed wildcard matcher to correctly handle Windows backslash path separators in pattern matching.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added
- Added `hasAllowedSkills()` method to `PermissionManager` that checks whether the resolved permission config has any explicitly allowed skills, returning true when the default skills policy is not "deny" or at least one individual skill entry has state "allow".
- Added skill-scoped `read` tool exception so the `read` tool remains exposed to agents with explicitly allowed skills even when the `read` tool-level permission is "deny", enabling skill file access without granting unrestricted read access.

### Changed
- Widened Pi peer dependency ranges to `^0.74.0 || ^0.75.0` and bumped dev dependencies to `^0.75.5`.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- Added `logPlaintextBashCommands` as an opt-in extension setting and settings-modal control; review logs redact raw bash command strings by default while retaining safe metadata.
- Added structured edit summaries for `replace`, `append`, `prepend`, `replace_text`, and `delete` payloads in permission prompts.
- Added skill-read enforcement for direct `read` calls under global and project Pi skill directories by inferring the skill name from the requested path when prompt entries are absent.

### Changed
- Hardened subagent permission forwarding with watched request directories, async request/response reads, and nonce-bound responses.
- Updated package metadata and lockfile version to `0.5.0` and migrated Pi peer dependency metadata to the `@earendil-works` scope.

## [0.4.9] - 2026-05-05

### Changed
- Permission-system config parsing now accepts JSONC comments and trailing commas across both policy files and the extension config, and invalid config warnings are emitted once per session as a compact single-line message with explicit fallback behavior.

### Fixed
- Stopped repeating identical invalid-config warnings in the TUI when the same broken permission policy is re-evaluated during the same session or reload cycle (thanks to @jviel-beta for issue #20).

## [0.4.8] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- Added runtime yolo-mode control through the `/permission-system` settings modal and `globalThis.__piPermissionSystem` for other extensions.
- Added wildcard support for `permission.tools` so direct tools from any extension can be controlled without adapter-specific hardcoding.
- Added `PI_PERMISSION_SYSTEM_POLICY_AGENT_DIR` so global policy and global agent override lookup can be pointed at a different agent root when needed.

### Changed
- Simplified `/permission-system` to only open the settings modal, removing the previous `show`, `path`, `reset`, `help`, and `yolo ...` subcommands.
- Expanded the README with an OpenCode-to-Pi migration guide covering agent file placement, frontmatter structure, permission mapping, Pi-specific `tools` vs `mcp` behavior, and policy-root overrides.

### Fixed
- Removed artifact validation that forced local runtime `config.json` values to match release defaults.
- Restored requested bash command text in permission review log entries while keeping prompts and generic tool payload previews redacted.
- Clarified last-declared-match wildcard precedence in the README and fixed wildcard-order examples/recipes so documented `tools` and `mcp` examples now match runtime behavior (thanks to @Nateowami for issue #17 and @gotgenes for the rule-order diagnosis).
- Replaced the removed `session_switch` lifecycle subscription with a single supported `session_start` refresh path so session changes rebuild runtime permission state without duplicate handlers (thanks to @gotgenes for PR #11).
- Removed stale README wording around exact-name tool matching and refreshed the documented architecture/module list to match the current extension layout.

## [0.4.7] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- Documented `PI_PERMISSION_SYSTEM_CONFIG_PATH` and `PI_PERMISSION_SYSTEM_LOGS_DIR` overrides for custom config and log locations.
- Added artifact validation to release checks for config defaults, schema support, README references, and package script safety.

### Changed
- Enforced trusted global/system `deny` floors so project-local policy layers can tighten permissions without relaxing higher-trust denies.
- Switched permission review audit entries to metadata hashes and lengths for prompts, commands, denial reasons, and tool input previews instead of raw sensitive content.

### Fixed
- Stopped publishing `config.json` in the package so fresh installs use the runtime default with yolo mode off by default (thanks to @Nateowami for PR #18).

## [0.4.6] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- Added bounded, sanitized tool input previews to permission review logs for non-bash/non-MCP tool calls, inspired by PR #10 from @DevkumarPatel.

### Changed
- Reused the extension's safe JSON serialization path for generic tool approval previews so circular values and BigInts are summarized without raw full-input logging.
- Updated `@mariozechner/pi-ai`, `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`, and `@mariozechner/pi-tui` peer dependencies to `^0.70.5`.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- Added a model option compatibility guard for OpenAI Responses/Codex streams so unsupported `temperature` values are removed from stream options and outgoing payloads before provider calls.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- Added runtime enforcement for the `external_directory` special permission on path-bearing tools (`read`, `write`, `edit`, `find`, `grep`, `ls`) before normal tool permission checks (thanks to @gotgenes for PR #9)
- Added readable `ask` prompt summaries for built-in file tools and bounded input previews for generic extension tools so users can make informed approval decisions (thanks to @beantownbytes for PR #8)
- Added `skill-prompt-sanitizer.ts` to parse and sanitize every `<available_skills>` block, including prompts with multiple skill sections

### Changed
- Updated `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` and `@mariozechner/pi-tui` peer dependencies to `^0.70.2`
- Refactored skill prompt filtering out of `src/index.ts` into a dedicated module for clearer ownership and reuse
- Permission prompts for `edit`, `write`, `read`, `find`, `grep`, and `ls` now show concise path/action summaries instead of raw multiline JSON

### Fixed
- Denied skills are now removed from all available-skill prompt blocks instead of only the first block
- Denied skill entries are no longer retained for later skill-read path matching after prompt sanitization
- External path access now honors `special.external_directory: deny` and blocks `ask` decisions when no UI or forwarding channel is available

### Tests
- Added runtime `tool_call` coverage for external directory deny, ask-without-UI, ask approval, internal path allow, and optional path omission
- Added prompt regression coverage for generic tool input previews and readable built-in file-tool approval summaries
- Added multi-block skill prompt sanitizer regression coverage

## [0.4.2] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- Added project-level permission layering from the active session workspace via `<cwd>/.pi/agent/pi-permissions.jsonc`
- Added project-level per-agent overrides via `<cwd>/.pi/agent/agents/<agent>.md` (thanks to @Talia-12 for PR #7)
- Added reload-aware permission manager refresh paths so policy caches are rebuilt when Pi reload events occur
- Added a dedicated `tests/` directory with modular test entrypoints and a shared test harness
- Added before-agent-start caching module to dedupe unchanged active-tool exposure and prompt state across `before_agent_start` lifecycle invocations
- Added `PermissionPromptDecision` type with `state` and `denialReason` fields for richer permission prompt resolution
- Added `getPolicyCacheStamp()` method to `PermissionManager` for cache invalidation tracking

### Changed
- Global path resolution now follows Pi's `getAgentDir()` helper, so global config, agents, sessions, and logs respect `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` (thanks to @jvortmann for PR #6)
- Updated `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` and `@mariozechner/pi-tui` peer dependencies to `^0.67.68`
- Updated TypeScript project configuration and npm scripts to run tests from `tests/` instead of `src/`
- Updated README documentation for project-level policy files, yolo mode config, test layout, and `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`
- Permission prompts and forwarding now return `PermissionPromptDecision` instead of boolean for richer resolution tracking
- Permission denial messages now include user-provided denial reasons when available

### Removed
- Removed the legacy packaged `asset/` directory because the README now uses externally hosted images instead of repository-bundled screenshots

### Fixed
- `/skill:<name>` permission handling now falls back to the current merged skill policy when no active agent context is available in the main session (thanks to @NSBeidou and @hidromagnetismo for reporting the issue)
- Skill denial messaging now reflects whether the block came from an agent-specific rule or the merged policy without agent context

### Tests
- Added coverage for project-level precedence across global, project, system-agent, and project-agent layers
- Added coverage for resolving config from `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`
- Added coverage for before-agent-start cache key generation and state deduplication
- Added coverage for cache invalidation on permission policy changes

- New `TOOL_GUIDELINE_RULES` configuration for extensible guideline filtering
- Helper functions: `findSection()`, `removeLineSection()`, `sanitizeGuidelinesSection()`

### Changed
- Updated `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` and `@mariozechner/pi-tui` peer dependencies to ^0.64.0

- Updated README documentation to cover extension config, logging, and event emission

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- `getToolPermission()` method to retrieve tool-level permission state without evaluating command-level rules, useful for tool injection decisions

## [0.1.8] - 2026-03-10

### Changed
- Refactored pattern compilation to support multiple sources for proper global+agent pattern merging
- Simplified `wildcard-matcher.ts` by removing unused `wildcardCount` and `literalLength` properties

### Changed
- Updated README documentation to describe system-prompt tool sanitization and refreshed the displayed package version.

### Fixed
- Prevented hidden tools from remaining advertised in the startup system prompt after runtime tool filtering.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-03-09
